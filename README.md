# HUDEditor-2020-v1.5
HUDEditor is a .lua-c script written in 2020. Updated in 2022. Allows you to change the colors of the interface and set the RGB overflow of HUD elements
  
  ## The script has some dependencies, including on CLEO. 

It also requires libraries from the ImGui series.

I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with the BLASTHACK theme before using it.
